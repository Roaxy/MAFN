## Getting Started

### Installation
Install the dependencies.

The code was tested on Ubuntu 20.04.6, with Python 3.7 and PyTorch v1.21.1.

1. Clone this repository.

    ~~~
    git clone https://github.com/Roaxy/MQN.git 
    ~~~
2. Create a new Conda environment with Python 3.7 then activate it:
   
    ~~~
   conda create -n MQN python==3.7
   conda activate MQN
    ~~~
3. Install pytorch v1.21.1 (CUDA 12.2 is used in this example).

    ~~~
    conda install pytorch=0.4.1 cudatoolkit=9.0 torchvision -c pytorch
    ~~~
    
4. Install the requirements.
    
    ~~~
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ~~~
